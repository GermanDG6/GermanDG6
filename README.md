<br/><hr>
## I'm a SOftware Developer.
 In the year 2021, I have reinvented myself and changed my professional career. I did a Bootcamp remotely, where I did my first projects:

### [OFFROAD IRONBIKE MTB]
### [MUSICLY]
### [APPLANT]

 After finishing the Bootcamp, I have continued learning and practising coding, and also I **collaborated** with a few companies like **TeamNOBOX** or **Leadsie**. I am also going to a **coliving/coworking** environment every day, interacting with people from many countries, where I am practising to improve my communication skills in English because my native language is Spanish.

  I love **nature** :evergreen_tree: and **sport** :mountain_bicyclist: (even more when I combine them :climbing:) and culture in general, but especially **music** :notes:. I am a **curious person** and I love to know why things happen :raised_eyebrow:.

  Before I changed my professional life I was a sound technician :microphone: and worked in a theatre :classical_building: :loud_sound:. This past made me acquire a lot of **skills**.
